# Yeoman.io

Made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), is a static generator in Ruby.

## Getting started

The best way to install Jekyll is via RubyGems:

	gem install jekyll

Once Jekyll is installed, you just need to clone the project:

	git clone git@github.com:zenorocha/yeoman.io.git

Then go to the project's folder:

	cd yeoman.io

And run:

	jekyll --server

Now you can see the website running in `localhost:4000` :D

## Build

To generate the files, just run:

	jekyll

It will create a folder called `_site`. Upload it's content to your server.
