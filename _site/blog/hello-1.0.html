<p><img alt="The Yeoman 1.0 Team" src="http://i.imgur.com/ckKa3jC.jpg"></p>

<p>For those who haven&#39;t tried Yeoman yet, or have been waiting for 1.0, just tell your terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">npm install -g yo
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you&#39;ve already used any of the 1.0 Release Candidates, you&#39;ll feel right at home with this upgrade. You&#39;re in for more of the same stable, happy relationships you&#39;ve had with yo and your favorite generators.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">npm update -g yo
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember, you&#39;ll need to install a generator using <code>yo</code> or <code>yo</code> followed by a generator name like <code>yo angular</code> before you see the options below :)</p>

<h2>What&#39;s New In 1.0?</h2>

<p><img alt="A new `yo` helpful prompt system" src="http://i.imgur.com/TY9OpoC.png"></p>

<p>Some of the interesting developments over the past year have included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Separating out <code>yo</code> from <code>yeoman</code>, positioning it as a first-class scaffolding solution for the web.</p></li>
<li><p>A completely rewritten generator system with rich prompts (checkbox, list, etc. thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js">Inquirer.js</a>, file utilities and more.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator/pull/311">Major performance improvements</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator/issues/305">automation of install steps</a>. Generators can now install all their peer dependencies, meaning you can just run: <code>npm install generator-angular</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A new <code>yo</code> <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo/pull/36">helpful prompt system</a>. Just running <code>yo</code> without specifying a generator will let you easily update your generators, search for and install new generators, and find help.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Yeoman?</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re new to Yeoman, you&#39;ll have <em>a lot</em> of power at your fingertips with just one <code>yo ____</code> command. For help getting started, try out these resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Yeoman <a href="http://yeoman.io/gettingstarted.html">Getting Started Guide</a> will help understand how to use Yo, Grunt, and Bower together efficiently.</p></li>

</div>

<p>To recap, here are some of the things you can look forward to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Generators extending from other generators.</p></li>
<li><p>Less scaffolding prompts. Your preferences will be remembered.</p></li>
<li><p>Less flags. <code>yo</code> can be all you need to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>Drop-in features. Need CoffeeScript?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Many more improvements for generator authors also await. You can follow and contribute to the discussion about where we&#39;re headed at <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo.next">yo.next</a> on GitHub.</p>
