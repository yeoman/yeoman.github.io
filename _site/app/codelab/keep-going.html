<h2>Like what you see? Yeoman can do more.</h2>

<p>Yeoman supports scaffolding out a lot more for Angular and other frameworks than what we’ve shown today.</p>

<p>For example, the Angular generator also supports creating new views, directives and controllers for you. A new controller can be scaffolded by running <code>yo angular:route routeName</code>, which will create your controller files but also update the route in <em>app.js</em> for you. We also try scaffolding out unit tests where possible.</p>

<p>To find out all the Yeoman commands for the Angular generator take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular#readme">generator readme</a>.</p>

<h2>Where to go next</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>AngularJS</strong> (<a href="http://angularjs.org">angularjs.org</a>) helped us write this Todo app quickly and with elegance. To dig deeper into the sweet spots of AngularJS, take a look at the detailed <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/overview">documentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grunt</strong> (<a href="http://gruntjs.com">gruntjs.com</a>) has tasks for almost anything you might like to do with your app, whether it’s <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass">compiling CoffeeScript</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect">hooking up your app to custom middleware</a> like PHP or Express. Your Yeoman app already has a <em>Gruntfile.js</em> already set up for you so read up on how to configure more Grunt tasks <a href="http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bower</strong> (<a href="http://bower.io">bower.io</a>) has a growing collection of easily installable packages for adding capabilities to your app. View all the packages available through Bower&#39;s registry <a href="http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yeoman</strong> is always evolving. Be sure to check out <a href="http://yeoman.io">yeoman.io</a> for more information and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/yeoman">@yeoman</a> and <a href="https://plus.sandbox.google.com/101063139999404044459/posts">+Yeoman</a> to stay up to date.</p></li>
