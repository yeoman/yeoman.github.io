<h1>Yeoman Weekly Team Meeting Notes</h1>

<p>The Yeoman core team mets each week to discuss what we&#39;ve been working on and the direction of the project.
We&#39;ve been using Google Docs for our meeting notes over the past year, but are experimenting with using
the site for this. It improves openness and can be referenced more easily &lt;3</p>
