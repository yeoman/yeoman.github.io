<p>The Yeoman workflow is comprised of three core tools for improving your productivity and satisfaction when building a web app. These tools are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo">yo</a> - the scaffolding tool from Yeoman</li>
<li><a href="http://bower.io">bower</a> - the package management tool</li>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com">grunt</a> - the build tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these projects are independently maintained by their respective communities, but work well together as a part of a prescriptive workflow for keeping you effective. Let’s walk through what these binaries can do.</p>

</p>

<h2>yo</h2>

<p>Yo is maintained by the Yeoman project and offers web application scaffolding, utilizing scaffolding templates we refer to as generators. You typically install yo and any generators you think you might use via npm.</p>

<h3>Installing yo and some generators</h3>

<p>First, you&#39;ll need to install <code>yo</code> and other required tools:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>npm install -g yo
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>npm is the package manager for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and comes bundled with it.</em></p>

<p><em>On Windows, we suggest you use an improved command line tool such as Console2 or PowerShell to improve the experience.</em></p>

<h3>Basic scaffolding</h3>

<p>To scaffold a web application, you&#39;ll need to install the <code>generator-webapp</code> generator:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>npm install -g generator-webapp
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the default web application generator that will scaffold out a project containing <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a>, and <a href="http://twbs.github.io/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. You&#39;ll have a choice during the interactive prompts to not include many of these.</p>

<p>Now that the generator is installed, create a directory for your new project</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>mkdir my-yo-project
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>my-yo-project
</code></pre></div>
<p>and then run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>yo webapp
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each project created with yo will also pull in relevant Grunt tasks which the community feels is needed or useful for your workflow.</p>

<p>The webapp generator is considered the simplest possible start for a web app. We also provide some framework generators which can be used to scaffold out a project and later views, models, controllers and so on.</p>

<h4>Example: Scaffolding an AngularJS app</h4>

<p>As always, before using a new generator, you must install it from npm first:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>npm install -g generator-angular
</code></pre></div>
<p>After that, create a new directory for your application, then run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular
</code></pre></div>
<p>Many generators allow you to customize your application by using flags from the initial command. As an example, with <code>generator-angular</code>, you can enter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular --minsafe
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we are first generating the file structure for a basic web application and then writing a number of boilerplate files for a new AngularJS application on top of it. This includes boilerplate directives and controllers as well as scaffolded Karma unit tests.</p>

<h5>Scaffolding out your Angular app’s pieces</h5>

<p>Some generators can also be used to scaffold further pieces of your application - we call these sub-generators.</p>

<p>In the AngularJS framework, for example, your application is made up of a number of pieces including controllers, directives and filters. You can actually scaffold out any of these pieces (and more) during your development workflow as shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular:controller myController
<span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular:directive myDirective
<span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular:filter myFilter
<span class="nv">$ </span>yo angular:service myService
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each framework generator has further documentation available noting what sub-generators it supports.</p>

<h3>Creating your own generators</h3>

<h2>Bower</h2>

<p>Bower is a package manager for the web which allows you to easily manage dependencies for your projects. This includes assets such as JavaScript, images and CSS. It is maintained by Twitter and the open-source community.</p>

<p>Managing packages using Bower can be done using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c"># Search for a dependency in the Bower registry.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower search &lt;dep&gt;

<span class="c"># Install one or more dependencies.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower install &lt;dep&gt;..&lt;depN&gt;

<span class="c"># List out the dependencies you have installed for a project.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower list

<span class="c"># Update a dependency to the latest version available.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower update &lt;dep&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Using Bower with a project scaffolded using yo</h3>

<p>To create a basic web app with a dependency on a jQuery plug-in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c"># Scaffold a new application.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>yo webapp

<span class="c"># Search Bower&#39;s registry for the plug-in we want.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower search jquery-pjax

<span class="c"># Install it and save it to bower.json</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>bower install jquery-pjax --save

<span class="c"># If you&#39;re using RequireJS...</span>
<span class="c"># (be aware that currently the webapp generator does not include RequireJS and the following command only applies to generators that do)</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt bower
<span class="c"># Injects your Bower dependencies into your RequireJS configuration.</span>

<span class="c"># If you&#39;re not using RequireJS...</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt wiredep
<span class="c"># Injects your dependencies into your index.html file.</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p><em>Your chosen generator may not include the grunt tasks &quot;bower&quot; and &quot;bowerInstall&quot;. You can read more about how to install and use these at <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-bower-requirejs">grunt-bower-requirejs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/stephenplusplus/grunt-bower-install">grunt-bower-install</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Grunt</h2>

<p>Grunt is a task-based command-line tool for JavaScript projects. It can be used to build projects, but also exposes several commands which you will want to use in your workflow. Many of these commands utilize Grunt tasks under the hood which are maintained by the Yeoman team.</p>

<h3>Grunt commands</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="c"># Preview an app you have generated (with Livereload).</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt serve

<span class="c"># Run the unit tests for an app.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt <span class="nb">test</span>

<span class="c"># Build an optimized, production-ready version of your app.</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt
</code></pre></div>
<p>These commands can be used together with the yo binary for a seamless development workflow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sh language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="nv">$ </span>yo webapp
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt serve
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt <span class="nb">test</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>grunt
</code></pre></div>
