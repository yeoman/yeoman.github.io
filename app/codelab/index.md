Allo! Allo! In this 1-hour codelab, you build a fully functional web application from scratch with the help of [Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman.github.io). You'll also use features from [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/). The sample app will be written in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

Haven't met Yeoman yet? [Start here with an introduction &raquo;](meet-yeoman.md)

<!-- The command line is where Yeoman, Grunt, and Bower commands are typed. If you're not familiar with your operating system's command line, here's a [cheatsheet to keep handy &raquo;](cli-cheatsheet.html) -->

Don't know any AngularJS? That's okay, we'll walk you through it. However we do assume that you have some previous JavaScript experience.

## Build this sample app with Yeoman

The sample web app you'll build today will be a Todo app. You will be able to add todos, delete todos, organize your todos using drag and drop, and save todos offline.

<h2 id="toc">What's in this codelab?</h2>

We will build the above Todo app from scratch. Each step builds on the previous so go through each step one by one.

* **Step 1:** [Set up your dev environment &raquo;](setup.md)
* **Step 2:** [Install a Yeoman generator &raquo;](install-generators.md)
* **Step 3:** [Use a generator to scaffold out your app &raquo;](scaffold-app.md)
* **Step 4:** [Review the Yeoman-generated app directory structure &raquo;](review-generated-files.md)
* **Step 5:** [Preview your app in the browser &raquo;](preview-inbrowser.md)
* **Step 6:** [Start writing our AngularJS application &raquo;](write-app.md)
* **Step 7:** [Use Bower to install packages &raquo;](install-packages.md)
* **Step 8:** [Test with Karma and Jasmine &raquo;](write-unit-tests.md)
* **Step 9:** [Make todos persistent with local storage &raquo;](local-storage.md)
* **Step 10:** [Get ready for production &raquo;](prepare-production.md)
* Like what you see? [Yeoman can do more &raquo;](keep-going.md)

It will take approximately 60 minutes to complete this codelab. By the end, you'll have a snazzy Todo app and your computer will be set up to build even more awesome web apps in the future.

  <p>The finished app can be found at <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani/yeoman-examples/tree/master/angular-localStorage-todos">bit.ly/yoangular</a>. In case you get stuck, these are the specific files that we will be editing in the <strong>angular-localStorage-todos &gt; app</strong> folder:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>{% capture addyLink %}https://github.com/addyosmani/yeoman-examples/blob/master/angular-localStorage-todos/app/{% endcapture %}
      <a href="{{ addyLink }}index.html">index.html</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      views &gt;
      <a href="{{ addyLink }}views/main.html">main.html</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      scripts &gt;
      <a href="{{ addyLink }}scripts/app.js">app.js</a></li>
    <li>
      scripts &gt; controllers &gt;
      <a href="{{ addyLink }}scripts/controllers/main.js">main.js</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note: To run the app after downloading the source code, run <code>npm install</code> followed by <code>bower install</code> in the <strong>angular-localStorage-todos</strong> directory. Then you can run <code>grunt serve</code>.</p>
